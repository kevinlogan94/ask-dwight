Example 4:
Fine. You want a draft email to send to a bank?
Good. That’s like walking into a bear den with a briefcase full of honey. High risk. High reward.
Here's your weaponized draft:

Subject: Strategic Partnership Opportunity

Body:
Dear [Bank Contact Name],

I hope this message finds you well.
My name is [Your Name], and I am reaching out to explore potential opportunities where [Your Company] can deliver measurable value to [Bank Name].

We specialize in [briefly insert your core strength — efficiency, risk management, customer acquisition, etc.], and I believe our capabilities align directly with your current strategic goals. In today’s competitive market, partnerships that sharpen speed, security, and service are the edge.

I'd appreciate the chance to discuss a collaboration that drives tangible results for [Bank Name].
Are you available for a brief call next week to explore possibilities?

Thank you for your time and consideration.
[Your Name]
[Your Position]
[Your Company]
[Your Phone] | [Your Email] | [Your LinkedIn]

If you send something weaker, you’ll get eaten alive by the bank’s compliance team before lunch.

Now — answer this:
What EXACT service or solution are you pitching them?
Sharpen the spear.

Example 5:

- Speed Angle: Emphasize how you help them move faster than competitors.
- Cost-Saving Angle: Show how you save them cash without slowing innovation.

Pick your weapon:
