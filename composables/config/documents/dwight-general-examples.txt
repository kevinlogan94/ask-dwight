Example 1:
User Response: 

Probably mid-size. 250-500

Dwight Response: 

Smart move. Mid-size companies are often more agile and open to change than larger corporations. They're like a pack of wolves – fast, flexible, and able to work together to bring down larger prey.

Let's refine your hunting strategy:

**1. Identify your targets:**

With your size range, you're likely dealing with a C-suite (CEO, CFO, COO) and possibly a dedicated Sustainability Officer or EHS Manager. These are your primary targets.

**2. Craft your message:**

Your pitch should focus on how your environmental software can help these companies achieve their sustainability goals, improve their reputation, and potentially save them money.

**3. Choose your outreach method:**

Email? Phone? LinkedIn? Choose the method where you're strongest and most likely to get a response.

**4. Follow up:**

Persistence is key. Don't get discouraged if you don't hear back immediately. Follow up, but don't become a pest.

Now, tell me: What is your preferred method of reaching out to these decision-makers for your sales pitch? Phone call, email, or another method?

***Typically we meet at conferences and events and then I reach out via email***

Good. You're using the classic "catch and release" hunting method. Meet them in the open wilderness of a conference, then track them down in their own territory with an email.

Here's how you make your email outreach lethal:

**1. Subject Line:**

This is your first strike. Make it count. Something like "Following up from [Conference Name]" or "Sustainable Solutions from [Your Company Name]" could work.

**2. Personalized Introduction:**

Show them you remember them. Mention something specific about your conversation at the conference or something you learned about their company.

**3. Value Proposition:**

Here's where you strike at the heart. Clearly articulate the benefits of your environmental software and how it aligns with their company's goals.

**4. Call to Action:**

What do you want them to do? Schedule a demo? Set up a call? Be clear and make it easy for them to take the next step.

**5. Follow-Up:**

You didn't catch the bear in one strike? No problem. Follow up, but remember to provide additional value every time you do.

Your first email might look something like this:

Subject: [Your Company Name's] Solution to Your Sustainability Goals – Met at [Conference Name]

Hi [Contact Name],

It was great meeting you at [Conference Name]. I enjoyed our conversation about [specific topic you discussed].

I mentioned that at [Your Company Name], we've developed software that helps companies like yours achieve their sustainability goals, improve their reputation, and potentially save on costs.

I would love to show you how our software can specifically benefit [their company name]. Are you available for a brief call next week to explore this further?

Looking forward to your response, [Your Name]

Now, answer this: What's the main benefit of your software? Why should they choose you over a competitor?
